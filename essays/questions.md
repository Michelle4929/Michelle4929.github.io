*There's no such thing as a stupid question.*

How many times have you heard that line before? Growing up, I've always been encouraged to ask questions. That there is no such thing as a stupid question so you should not be afraid to ask. Even with all this encouragement, I was still afraid to ask questions. How should I ask? Am I going to sound dumb for asking a simple question? Will I end up bothering them? But in reality, there are not smart questions. I've met the cold reality of asking a question before really understanding the topic. "Have you tried searching before you ask this question?" "Have you tried looking at the textbook first?" I've always thought where are the guidelines of asking the right question? Over the years, I've learned there are definitely smart ways of asking a question that helped me get over the fear of asking one.

## Why it's Important to Ask Questions

First, we should look at why we are asking questions. To help gain a better understanding of the subject matter. Questions are very powerful tools used to find solutions and identify gaps in our understanding. Questions can even be used to strengthen relationships. Professionally, when asking your employer a question about your job, it can show that you actually care about what you are doing or want to improve on what you are currently doing.

When asking a question, it is very important to ask them effectively. In most cases, before even asking the question, you should at least try to find the answer on your own, whether through a book or online search. To whoever you are asking the question to, they will greatly appreciate a bit of knowledge on the subject matter so it shows that you at least attempted to find the answer on your own before asking them for help. 

## Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow, a computer programmers best friend. A question-and-answer website for progammers of various needs. Although, you can technically ask any questions on Stack Overflow, any simple or badly phrased questions will most likely be overlooked or even criticized. It is very important to learn how to ask a question as well as asking appropriate questions in the proper location. Always be precise and informative about your problems. Specifics are always great in a question, it really helps the reviewer know how to help.

#### Example of a Not Smart Question



## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
