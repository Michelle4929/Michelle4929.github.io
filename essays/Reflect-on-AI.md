### I. Introduction

In this day and age, most people have heard about AI. Artificial Intelligence is technology that enables machines to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings, such as humans. In education, most students in modern times know how to use AI, such as ChatGPT, copilot, and much more. The big question being how helpful is AI in terms of education and helping students without being detrimental to their learning. There are always two sides to a coin with some supporting the aid of AI and others disagreeing that AI encourages dishonesty in terms of learning. AI is generally a tool to assist people to work more efficiently and to proof check their work. In those terms, AI has both a positive and negative impact to one's education. As students should not rely on AI to do all their work but should be used to learn or help improve one's current work.

For software engineers, AI can be used in multiple different ways, such as enhancing code efficiency for improved productivity. In that aspect, AI automates common tasks and offers problem-solving approaches when one gets stuck. Although, AI can produce key information or answers to your solution, it should not be 100% relied on as its information is not always correct. I personally think it is important to understand the basics of the topic before asking AI. As an ICS student, I've used ChatGPT on many occasions to debug my code. Although AI has helped on multiple occasions, it also gave wrong solutions just as much. In that case, it was important that I understood how to program/code as ChatGPT could give me different solutions but I would have to know how to read and understand what exactly I would use and change to fit my problems.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18: I did not use AI for experience homework WODs. As these were WODs to help us practice for our in-class WODs, I wanted to see if I was able to solve them on my own first. If I was unable to solve them initially, the class provided enough material for me to look for aide in where I was stuck before I had the chance to use AI to assist me.

  2. In-class Practice WODs: I did not use AI for in-class practice WODs as well. With the same mindset as experience homework WODS, I wanted to see if I could solve them on my own without help from AI but only from sources provided from the class.

  3. In-class WODs: I have used AI for several WODs. In the beginning, I didn't want to use AI, such as ChatGPT to help but as WODs became essentially harder to meet the time through each week. I found myself having to use ChatGPT on multiple occasion to debug my code or for styling issues. Especially when we started using bootstrap meteor, it was my first time using bootstrap functions so on multiple occasions, I found myself asking ChatGPT on how to use certain calls or why my website did not display what I wanted. For example, in the Morning Brew WOD, I asked ChatGPT: "In meteor bootstrap, how do I get my text to display over an image?", which it outputed:
