### What Software Enginnering Means to Me

This software engineering course has been a pleasant surprise for me. Coming in with a keen interest but unsure of what to expect, I've been positively surprised by the different specs of the material covered. While my initial interest was sparked by a fascination with software engineering, I wasn't entirely sure how it would translate into a classroom setting. However, the practical knowledge gained in this course has given me a clearer understanding of real-world software development. From breaking down tasks to designing reusable solutions, the skills learned here are directly applicable to future projects.

Throughout this software engineering course, I've discovered that it's not just about building web applications; it's about mastering fundamental concepts that apply to any project. Two key takeaways for me are User Interface (UI) Frameworks and Design Patterns.

### User Interface (UI) Frameworks

UI frameworks are like toolkits that make it easier for developers to create user interfaces for all sorts of projects, like websites, desktop programs, and mobile apps. These frameworks provide a set of rules and tools that help developers design interfaces that are easy to use and look good. So, whether you're making a website or a mobile app, UI frameworks give you everything you need to make it work and look nice.

For example, the group project I did for this class was a studylink application aimed to provide a platform for students to connect, collaborate, and support each other in their academic pursuits. Understanding the importance of a user-friendly interface for fostering engagement, I turned to UI frameworks to streamline the design process and enhance the overall user experience. One of the pivotal features was the creation of study sessions and a shared calendar function accessible to all users. Moreover, integrating a shared calendar function into the application required careful consideration of usability and accessibility. Here, the UI framework's support for interactive components and data visualization proved invaluable. By incorporating a calendar component with features like event scheduling, the application's calendar function became a central hub for coordinating study sessions and managing academic schedules collaboratively.

### Design Patterns

Using AI has definitely influenced my learning experience in terms of comprehension and efficiency. I found myself over the years depending on AI more for each class. Whenever I find myself stuck in a situation of confusion, I end up asking AI for help in understanding or fixing my problem. What I have learned is that AI is not always right, of course formatting the question correctly is also important but a lot of the times you need to actually understand the the material as well. If you just end up asking AI blindly on giving you an answer, you will have come out of that experience learning absolutely nothing as well as not even knowing if that answer is correct. AI has definitely enhanced my learning in software engineering concepts as if you are a programmer, there will be multiple times you get stuck and have to dig yourself out of the hole. I used to not use AI when I first started coding and I found myself just staring at my code for hours on end, which it would end up being a simple one letter bug that AI would've found for me in seconds. I think it's important to work alongside AI to help increase efficiency but know how to do the work as well.

### IV. Practical Applications:

AI definitely has practical applications you can use in the real-world outside of school. AI applications have proven effective in addressing real-world problems across various domains by data-driven insights, automation, and predictive analytics. For example, in terms of environmental conservations, AI is used to effectively monitor ecosystems, track wildlife populations, and detect environmental changes. AI can and is being used in multiple fields, such as in finance. AI is employed for fraud detection, risk assessment, customer service automation, and much more. There are many ways AI applications address real-world software engineering challenges. For example, AI technologies support collaborative software development practices by facilitating knowledge sharing, code reuse, code maintenance, and automation.These examples illustrate the diverse applications of AI across various industries and domains. AI will continue to evolve and grow across different fields and sections. 

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:

Although AI potential is possibly limitless, it comes with its limitations and challenges. Specifically throughout ICS 314, I experienced the challenges of using AI to help debug my code or finding a solution to my problems. A lot of times, AI will give you basic framework but won't exactly execute what you need specifically. For example, when I attempted to create spacing in between my columns for one of the experience WODs. ChatGPT suggested making my columns bigger instead. Potential opportunities for integrating AI specifically in the software engineering education side would be offering dedicated AI courses/tracks, collaborative research projects, and guest lectures and workshops.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:

Traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches in the context of software engineering education both have their pros and cons. Traditional teaching usually offers a more engaging experience which relies on in-person lectures, readings, and assignments. Although at times, if it's too lecture based it would not be as engaging but more passive learning as students may not be paying attention. While AI- enhanced approaches may not be engaging in terms of being personal with someone teaching you in-person but it might be more engaging through interactive learning. As it requires students to be more involved in how they use the AI to further improve their skills and knowledge. In terms of practical skill and knowledge retention, traditional teaching methods tend to be more conceptual based, which often limit hands-on practice and affects knowledge retention. While AI-enhanced approaches may facilitate skill and knowledge retention just by being hands-on.

### VII. Future Considerations:

The future of AI in software engineering education will always be evolving, as software engineering focuses on advancing technological items/concepts. AI can help in productivity, efficiency, and skill development which would help future students of the field. Although there would be several challenges as well since you wouldn't want students to become to dependent on AI to do all their work for them without actually understanding the work. Areas for improvement would definitely be collaborative but also ethical in terms of enhancing learning experience and fostering innovation without taking away the future potential of students.

### VIII. Conclusion:

In conclusion, I've explored the multifaceted role of AI in software engineering education, drawing from personal experiences and reflections. I've delved into the benefits and challenges of utilizing AI tools like ChatGPT across various educational contexts, including debugging code, understanding concepts, and generating ideas for essays. Through my narrative, I've underscored the importance of striking a balance between leveraging AI assistance and fostering a deep understanding of core concepts, emphasizing the need for active engagement in the learning process. Additionally, there are practical applications of AI in addressing real-world software engineering challenges and the potential for future integration of AI in education. Overall, the relationship between AI and learning within the realm of software engineering education should be balanced.
