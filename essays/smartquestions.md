*There's no such thing as a stupid question.*

How many times have you heard that line before? Growing up, I've always been encouraged to ask questions. That there is no such thing as a stupid question so you should not be afraid to ask. Even with all this encouragement, I was still afraid to ask questions. How should I ask? Am I going to sound dumb for asking a simple question? Will I end up bothering them? But in reality, there are not smart questions. I've met the cold reality of asking a question before really understanding the topic. "Have you tried searching before you ask this question?" "Have you tried looking at the textbook first?" I've always thought where are the guidelines of asking the right question? Over the years, I've learned there are definitely smart ways of asking a question that helped me get over the fear of asking one.

## Why it's Important to Ask Questions

First, we should look at why we are asking questions. To help gain a better understanding of the subject matter. Questions are very powerful tools used to find solutions and identify gaps in our understanding. Questions can even be used to strengthen relationships. Professionally, when asking your employer a question about your job, it can show that you actually care about what you are doing or want to improve on what you are currently doing.

When asking a question, it is very important to ask them effectively. In most cases, before even asking the question, you should at least try to find the answer on your own, whether through a book or online search. To whoever you are asking the question to, they will greatly appreciate a bit of knowledge on the subject matter so it shows that you at least attempted to find the answer on your own before asking them for help. 

## Stack Overflow

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
