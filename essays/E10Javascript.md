*What is Javascript?*

  Javascript is a programming language for creating dynamic web pages, such as content, multimedia, animated images, and much more. Although there are many different programming languages out there like Javascript, my first language I learned was Java. Compared to Java I am fairly new to Javascript, which after trying it, I realized there were a lot of similarities as well as differences. In terms of coding, the syntax and programming concepts were similar, which made it easy to transition certain aspects. For example, programming loops, conditional statmements, and syntax signs such as end code statements.
For differences, I would say the first thing I noticed was that Javascript felt more lax than Java. Java strongly checks its variables and functions before compilation, which makes it very object oriented. In comparison, Javascript would still compile if I changed my string varaible into an integer, which I feel like in the long run, could cause higher chances of error.

## How I feel about Javascript

  My first experiences with Javascript was mostly positive due to how much easier it was to learn and implement. I felt like the syntax was simpler than the other two languages I dipped my knowledge into, being Java and C. Of course, I did make mistakes transitioning between the languages, despite the similarities, they are still different programming languages. For example, when writing a function on Javascript, you can just write *function* "name", with the parameters. Compared to Java, you would have to classify and state each part of a function, such as "public class Main". I also have a lot more to learn, in order to confidently say that I can do Javascript.

## Athletic software engineering and WODs

  Athletic software engineering is a teaching method which involves high intensity, time constraining stressful approaches to developing software engineering skills. Instead of sticking with a regular lecture, that involves the professor mostly talking about the material. Athletic software engineering incorporates WODs, workouts of the day. A WOD is a coding exercise that requires you to solve a problem within a certain time limit. It would be my first time experiencing athletic software engineering with WOD focused classes.

## My reflection on the current WODs

  As I did my first ever WOD on ProjectEuler, I realized the overwhelming benefits but stressful method of learning. Project Euler was an exercise that required making a code to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below 1000 within a time frame of 8 minutes. Up to that moment, I have never done a timed coding seesion before. Most of my coding sessions were at leisure, just with the time constraint of a due date. In that aspect, I was very stressed during my first WOD. Although the problem was fairly simple, I found myself struggling with syntaxes/methods I wasn't used to, as well as the pressure of finishing on time. I am typically a slow coder, so even though I am struggling with the WODs currently, I am hopeful that it will help me critically solve coding problems faster and withhold the pressure of solving within a time constraint!
