## Software Engineering

Software engineering is one of the many different branches of computer science. Maybe we should first delve into what even computer science. Computer science is the study of computers and computation systems. It focuses on the development and testing of software and software systems. I've had many people confuse computer science and information technology(IT) as the same thing. Although both involve computers, computer science focuses on the development of software while IT focuses on the implementation, support, and management of computers. In other words, software engineers make the systems, while IT professionals make sure the computers and systems work well for all users.

Software engineering deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. They use engineering principles to solve real-world problems involving computers. There are many different programming languages to start designing and developing software. I may only have knowledge of Java and C at the moment, but I am very excited to acquire new programming languages along my journey in computer science. I have recently started learning Javascript and am looking forward to how much more I will improve.

## Why do coding?

As a computer science major, there definitely are a lot of pathways to choose from. I can't say for sure which path I will take since I am still learning but I can say that I am interested in software engineering. Before this year, I have never taken a single software engineering class. It's very obvious but you do need to know a bit about coding before learning about software engineering since it does focus on designing and testing software programs. As a student who only started learning how to code in college, I feel that software engineering is very essential to my career. Already I have experienced the pressure of problem solving many different scenarios through software engineering. As I am still mastering my fundamentals, I hope to be able to develop fast problem-solving skills as well as creativity when it comes to different types of codes.


## Conclusion

So how exactly soft is engineering for you? Of course, there are many different ways to interpret this question. I'm sure from one programmer to the next, the answer may be very different!
