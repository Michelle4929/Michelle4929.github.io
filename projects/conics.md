## Conics

"What are conics? Conic is a curve obtained from a right conical surface within a plane. The conic consist of the focus, directrix, and the eccentricity. In other words, the fixed ratio between the distance of one point from another that constructs a curve. Traditionally, there are three different type of conics, the ellipse, hyperbola, and parabola. Our project focused on hyperbolas. Hyperbolas are open curves that are symmetrical and formed by a circular cone intersecting a plane at a smaller angle. Some real life examples of hyperbolas are guitars(its sides form hyperbola), Dulles Airport(has a designt of hyperbolic parabloic), and the Kobe Port Tower(has an hourglass shape formed by two hyperbolas) which we did our school project on.

## Relationship Between Conics and the Kobe Port Tower

When I was in high school, my teammates and I did a project mathematically proving the relationship between conic and real life building structures. We do a lot of mathemathics growing up but we don't always get to apply it to real life. In this project, we built the Kobe tower (out of fizzy sticks), which is made up of hyperbolas to prove the importance of using mathematics in real life applications. The Kobe Port Tower is a hyperboloid structure that's shape is generated by rotating a hyperbola around its conjugate axis. We first wrote a research paper to understand the nature of conics and our test subject, the Kobe Tower. Then, we mathematically proved the hyperbolic shape using the formula for hyperbolas. Finally, we build the Kobe Tower using fizzy sticks to show the hyperboloid shape.

## What I Got Out of It

We learned that it takes a lot of teamwork to build projects together. Everybody had their own responsibility, whether it was getting the right angle on the fizzy sticks or making the base of the conic. After we finished the project, we appreciated the arhitects and engineers even more on building the actual Kobe Tower. It was harder than we expected but a lot of fun!
